================

This repository devises a basic coding project structure, as well as
some useful helper scripts for reproducibility amongst other things.

# First-order title

## Second-order title

### Third-order title

#### Fourth-order title

##### Fifth-order title

###### Sixth-order title

For GitHub-style documents, first-order titles are reserved for the
actual document title, as they are the same size as the title from the
header.

Second- to sixth-order titles are the way to go. Seventh- and
higher-order titles donâ€™t exist.

## GitHub documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to
GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and
a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](README_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
